    "text": "The Pew Global Attitude Survey (PGAS)\nThe PGAS is not exactly a pure scientific survey as the World Value Survey or the European Value Survey. It is enhanced in a long history as explained by a blog published on th website “Knowledge for Policy” of EU some years ago.\nThe Pew Global Attitudes Project was originally conceived with two primary objectives: to gauge attitudes in every region toward globalization; trade and an increasingly connected world; and to measure changes in attitudes toward democracy and other key issues among some of the European populations surveyed in the 13-nation 1991 benchmark survey; the Pulse of Europe (also directed by Dr. Albright and Mr. Kohut). After the terrorist attacks on September 11; 2001; the scope of the project was broadened to measure attitudes about terrorism; the intersection between the Islamic faith and public policy in countries with significant Muslim populations; and to probe attitudes toward the United States more deeply in all countries. Recent Global Attitudes surveys have gauged worldwide opinion about international news developments; including the war in Iraq. Over time; the project has surveyed more than 90000 people in 50 countries.\nSource : European Union, Knowledge for policy, 2022\nThe description presented by EU websiste is not accurate because, as we will see in our description of data, the coverage is today much more important than 90 000 people in 50 countries. And the post on the blog of EU has also forgotten to mention that one of the initial purposes of the Pew Charitable Trust, before 2001, was to follow not only the attitude of people toward democracy but also toward religion in the world.\nWe will complete this description later, but it is sufficient to remember that the PGAS is a political barometer of world opinion elaborated in the US after the shock of September 11, 2001."

    "text": "Five indicators for long time series\nFrom 2002 to 2023, 22 waves of the PGAS has been realized and the majority of questions has changed over time or have been formulated in a different way, which make comparisons difficult. We have therefore selected a very limited number of 5 questions which has kept exactly the same wording over time and has been asked in different waves.\n\nSample design by country and year\nThe time period (wav), the country investigated in the survey (sta) and the sex or age of the respondent are classical dimension that are used to frame the survey and choose the samples. Combined with a variable list of other framing indicators (education, urban-rural, income, …) they make possible to correct the samples by a weighting criteria (weight) which insure an adequation with the full population of the countries. In the majority of countries and time period, the sample size was about 1000 people, but can be sometimes lower (min = 500) or higher (max 3000). In developping countries, the survey was generally realized by face-to-face interveiw but in most developped countries (and also through time) most surveys has been realized by phone or eventually on the internet. All details on the country specific methodology by year are available and provide very usefull information on the technical and political difficulties of realization of the survey and the related margin of errors.\n\n\n\nExample of sampling methodology of PGAS\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of indicators\n\ntail(don,5)\n\n        wav sta       wgt    sex age                rel            opi_USA\n617341 2023 ZAF 1.8703222   Male  22     Very important   Very unfavorable\n617342 2023 ZAF 1.0502763   Male  24 Somewhat important Somewhat favorable\n617343 2023 ZAF 0.3254254   Male  39     Very important   Very unfavorable\n617344 2023 ZAF 2.4937630   Male  28     Very important                 DK\n617345 2023 ZAF 0.7725435 Female  24     Very important Somewhat favorable\n                  opi_CHN            opi_RUS             opi_UN\n617341     Very favorable     Very favorable     Very favorable\n617342     Very favorable Somewhat favorable Somewhat favorable\n617343   Very unfavorable   Very unfavorable   Very unfavorable\n617344   Very unfavorable   Very unfavorable                 DK\n617345 Somewhat favorable Somewhat favorable Somewhat favorable\n                   opi_EU opi_IRN opi_DEU opi_FRA opi_JPN            opi_IND\n617341     Very favorable    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;     Very favorable\n617342 Somewhat favorable    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt; Somewhat favorable\n617343   Very unfavorable    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;   Very unfavorable\n617344   Very unfavorable    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt; Somewhat favorable\n617345 Somewhat favorable    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt; Somewhat favorable\n                  opi_TWN opi_BRA\n617341     Very favorable    &lt;NA&gt;\n617342 Somewhat favorable    &lt;NA&gt;\n617343                 DK    &lt;NA&gt;\n617344                 DK    &lt;NA&gt;\n617345 Somewhat favorable    &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\n\nwav : the year where the survey has been realized. The precise period of time is indicated in the country specific methodology by year. The majority of surveys has been realized in Spring.\nsta : the state where the survey was realized. We use here the ISO3 code as reference in order to make more easy the cartography or the linkage with other data sources.\nwgt : the weight of observation that should be used to balance bias in the sample and obtain better estimates of values for each country and each year. This information was lost for some countries in 2002 and was therefore made equal to 1.\nsex : the sex of the person that answered. The Pew Research Center does not offer alternative answers for non binary people. It is generally not asked but directly recorded by the person in charge of the inquiries.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion on sex\n\n\n\nrel : the question about the importance of religion in the life of the respondent take the form of a scale with four ordered levels. The formulation has remained strictly the same over time which insure good quality of comparison. This question has been generally asked in all countries until 2015. But they were later some exceptions, in particular in countries of Europe like France, Germany or UK.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion on religion\n\n\n\nopi_xxx : this central question is much more complex than the previous one because it is a battery of questions about different countries but also sometimes different people, different organisation or even different religions. The general rule is to start by the question about the opinion of USA (and eventually “Americans”) and then to propose the other items in a random order. It suggest that USA/Americans are used as a reference around which we can measure positive or negative deviations. Another important complication with this question is the fact that some items are proposed to all countries under investigation but other are only asked in selected countries. In this case, we are oblige to admit that the comparison will be biased because the full list of items has a systemic influence on the results about each item. As an example, consider the formulation of the question in the waves of 2009 an 2019.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion on opinion about countries in 2009\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion on opinion about countries in 2019\n\n\nThe wording of the question is the same and the ordinal scale at four level is equivalent, but the fact that the list of items has changed introduce a difficulty in the analysis of the results, even if we decide to focus only the items that are present in the two waves (USA, China, Russia, EU, UN). In 2009, the evaluation is influenced by questions about religions which is not the case in 2019. Even if we consider a single year like 2019, the fact that NATO or Germany are added to the items in Europe but not in other countries of the world will probably modify the answers about Russia.\nConsidering the difficulties induced by the halo effect, we have decided to limit our selection of answers to the items that (1) has been asked to all countries and (2) the item that are about states or regional organization but not about peoples or religions. We will therefore not keep the answers about Germany and NATO in 2019 and no more consider the answers about Americans, Jews, Christians or Muslims in 2019.\n\n\nAvailability of indicators by waves\nThe table below indicates for each question the waves where it has been used.\n\n\n\nAvailability of indicator by waves of survey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n\n\n\n\nsta\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nsex\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nage\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nrel\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nopi_USA\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nopi_CHN\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nopi_RUS\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n\nopi_UN\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nopi_EU\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nopi_IRN\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nopi_DEU\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nopi_FRA\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nopi_JPN\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nopi_IND\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n\nopi_TWN\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n\nopi_BRA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0"

table deserve a lot of comment as it reveals at the same time (1) the evolution of choices made by the PGAS in their coverage of the world opinion, but also (2) the geopolitical constraints that made possible or not the realization of the survey in the target countries. Just a few examples, before a more precise investigation :\n\nThe countries that has been the most present in the 22 waves are members of “the Western” (Germany, France, UK, Spain, Japan, Poland) and can be considered as “friends” of the US. The US themselves has not been investogated in the final period 2021-2023, probably because the questions asked in PGAS are also asked in other national surveys of the Pew Research Center (PRC). It is certainly possible to find the data for these years elsewhere on the website of the PRC.\nRussia has been systematically investigated from 2002 to 2015 but not in 2016. Then present again in 2017-2019 but not after. We can imagine that the possibility to realize surveys in Russia became more difficult after the first war of Ukraine (2014) and impossible with the beginning of the Covid crisis (2020)\nChina was investigated in 2002 and in 2005-2016 but never after this period of time. As in the case of Russia, we can imagine that it became difficult and finally impossible to realize surveys in these country after the designation of Xi Jiping as head of state in 2013.\nIn the ‘South’, the coverage is much more important for large emerging countries (Indian Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, …) than smaller one.\nAfrica is less covered than Middle-East\netc.\n\nFrom statistical point of view we should just keep in the moment that the survey has been realized at least one time in 70 countries of the world. But only a minority of them are likely to be used for the analysis of trends over long period of time.\n\n\nMap of spatial coverage\nTo offer a better idea of the geographical selection of countries made by the PGAS, it is interesting to propose a map, describing the countries that has been covered or not and the number of waves where they was present.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the map, it appears very clearly an uneven spatial distribution with very spare coverage in Africa or central Asia as compared to Americas, Europa and Southern or Eastern Asia. The PGAS will therefore not offer a perfect basis for the analysis of the evolution of global opinion in the world. But it makes nevertheless possible to explore some great tendencies in all part of the worlds between 2002 and 2023."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nThe core period of interest is 2007-2019\nLooking at the availability of data by indicator and by survey, it appears clearly that the most favorable period of observation for the analysis of opinion dynamics is 2007-2019. In 2002-2006, many indicators was not avaiblable or many countries of interest was missing. And in 2020-23, the covid crisis and the increase of geopolitical conflicts between “North” and “South” has limited the possibilities to launch surveys in countries of major interest like China or Russia.\n\n\nThe most interesting opinions are about USA, China, Russia, EU and UN\nNow, considering the distribution of opinions at different periods of time and in different samples of countries, it appears that only USA, China and Russia are covered on a long period, eventually completed by EU and UN. The opinions about other countries (Germany, France, Japan, India, …) are only been asked to all countries in some waves. We could eventually add some information in the case of waves where the opinion of this countries has been asked to subsamples. But we prefer to exclud this partial informations."

But after the election of D. Trump in 2017, the proportion of people without opinion declined dramatically to less than 5 % and the election of J. Biden did not modify the situation.\n\n\nPolarisation of opinion\nThis first results are in line with another analysis related to the choice of extreme situation of the Likert scale. The figure below indicates the proportion of people that has chosen the answers “very favorable” or “very unfavorable”.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe notice here a high polarisation in 2002 (probably in relation with September 11 and the “war to terrorism” of G.W. Bush). But we reach the lowest level of polarisation in 2010-2014 during the presidency of B.Obama. The polarisation increase slowly during the second presidency of Obama and dramatically with the election of D. Trump. J. Biden election is characterized by a reduction of polarisation.\n\n\nBalance of opinion.\nWe use here the classical index of attraction-repulsion \\(I\\) to evaluate the balance of positive and negative opinion.\n\\(I = \\frac{Favorable-Unfavorable}{Favorable+Unfavorable}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally we can produce the classical diagram of the sum of favorable opinion that reveals expected correlation with the different presidents of the US. But this figure is only one component of the analysis and the two previous one about opinion and polarisation are certainly as much important.\n\n\nTrajectory with CA\nWe can use a correspondance analysis in order to visualize the general trajectory of opinions (excluding answers of people that refused or did not answer). The advantage of this statisticial method is to provide a good picture of the period of change or stability of opinion and to identify the most important turning points.\n\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Axis 1 (74% of inertia) is clearly associated to the opposition between favorable opinion (left) and unfavorable opinion (right). The Axis 2 is related to the degree of polarisation that can be higher (top) or lower (down).\nThe most extreme situations are observed in 2002 (very favorable opinion) and 2020 (very unfavorable opinion). They are both related to international events that has dramatically influenced the opinion of UK citizens on the US : sympathy in the case of the folow-up of septembr 11. attacks ; antipathy in the case of Trump présidence and covid crisis. These extreme points are generally not observed during a long period and we observe very strong distance between these years and the one located immediately before and after.\nLooking at the most important distances between two years, we notice very important jumps in 2002-2003 (begining of the second war in Iraq), 2008-2009 (election of Obama), 2016-2017 (election of Trump) and 2020-2021 (election of Biden).\n\nThis results suggest that it is not obvious to evaluate the opinion of a country about USA if we don’t have several points of observation through time and, ideally, a complete view of the trajectory."

has an opinion ?\nWe can firstly investigate the % of people that refused to answer or did not made a choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see on the figure, there is a great variability in the proportion of people that has formulated an opinion in the different countries where the survey has been realized. The countries where the maximum of people has refused to answer are Morocco (29%), Uganda (17%), Pakistan (16%) and Tanzania (13%). The reverse situation is observed in Côte d’Ivoire, France, and Lebanon where less than 1% of people did not formulated an opinion on USA.\n\n\nPolarisation\nWe can then investigate the degree of polarisation, defined as the proportion of people that used the extreme values of the likert scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most important levels of polarisation are observed in countries from Middle East characterized by very negative opinion of USA (Turkey, Palestiniant territories, Jordan, Pakistan, …) but also in countries from subsaharan Africa characterised by very positive opinion of USA (Nigeria, Côte d’ivoire, Mali, …). The countries with low level of polarisation are rather located in Asia (Korea, China, Japan, …), Europe (Czech republic, Italia, Poland, …) and Latin America (Brazil, Peru,…).\n\n\nBalance of favorable and unfavorable opinions\nWe use here the classical index of attraction-repulsion \\(I\\) to evaluate the balance of positive and negative opinion.\n\\(I = \\frac{Favorable-Unfavorable}{Favorable+Unfavorable}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe index of attraction-repulsion is theoretically bounded between -1 (all opinions are unfavorable) and + 1 (all opinions are favorable) with an equilibrium around 0 (equal number of favorable and unfavorable opinions). In present case, we observe a very strong diversity of positions from -0.81 in Turkey to +0.77 in Ivory Coast. The countries are to some extent clustered in regions with very negative opinions in Middle east and very positive in subsaharan Africa. But they are exceptions and we should not conclude too quickly because it is possible that people has systematically provide positive or negative answers to foreign countries proposed to their evaluation. As we will see later, the absolute opinion on USA is less interesting than the comparison between USA and other countries of reference like Chinaor Russia.\n\n\nMapping with CA\nWe can use a correspondance analysis in order to visualize the positions of countries about USA. We will obtain by this method a map of the world opinion where distance between positions reveals differences in opinions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure reveals clearly a “Guttman effect” which means that axis 1 and 2 should not be interprated separately but jointly. The countries are indeed distributed on a parabol that follow the order of opinions from the most unfavorable (topleft) to the moderate (bottom center) and the most favorable (topright).\nBut the countries are not regularly distributed along the parabol and we can easily identify clusters of countries sharing the same opinion on USA in 2007 : very unfavorable in arabic and muslim countries but also in Argentina ; very favorable in subsaharan Africa, Israel and USA ; moderate and equilibrated in other countries.\n\nBut this result is only a snapshot of the situation in 2007 and what we have to perform in next step is an analysis of the dynamic of positions of countries through time."
